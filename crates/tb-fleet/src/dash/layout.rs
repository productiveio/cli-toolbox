//! — are exactly the ones nobody renders while developing.
//!
//! The shape it plans is a **multi-line item**: the session name is the thing the
//! user orients by, so it gets a line to itself, and the prompt gets a line of its
//! own too — two lines on a desktop, three on a phone, where the terminal label
//! cannot share a line with the prompt without starving it. One line per session
//! is the opt-in (`z`, `--rows 1`) for when density beats legibility.
