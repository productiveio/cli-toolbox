//! Session name generation.
//!
//! Claude names a session after its cwd plus a short hash (`work-9d`), which
//! says nothing about the work. This module turns such a session into a
//! task-shaped slug (`cdc-backfill-retry`).
//!
//! The LLM is the *primary* source — `claude -p --model haiku` reading a small
//! context built from the cwd, the git branch and the session's first prompt.
//! [`heuristic_from`] is only the fallback for when `claude` is missing, logged
//! out, rate-limited or answers with prose.
//!
//! Nothing here applies a name. Generation is suggest-only; the caller confirms
//! (the TUI's rename buffer, or `tb-fleet name --apply`).
